    My fiance is has always been the best gift giver. It always blew my mind when she continuously picked the perfect present. How did she come up with such brilliance? The solution? Simple! Everytime one her friends or family mentioned something that they liked she would simply write it down!

    Who would use this? Who wouldn't use this! Your mom! Your dad! Your siblings! Any good friend!!!

    I wanted to make this simple easy to use app, one that I would use.
